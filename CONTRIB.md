# Data Requests

_This section is non-promisory. Rather, it is a way for us (and the community) to systematically surveil the analytical thinking surrounding the programme, and collate data constraints facing the open community. Submit a pull request to add to this list._

1) Brand of vaccine used in relation to `dose1_daily` and `dose2_daily`. Required to derive completion rates once single-dose vaccines are used, and could be beneficial for research regarding vax efficacy.
2) To have similar fields from `vaxreg_state.csv` in `vax_state.csv` - this will help to compare the registration and vaccination data.
3) List of PPVs by state, including location name, lat/lon, and address.
4) Breakdown of daily vaccinations by program, i.e. under PICK, SelVax, PIKAS, or others.
5) Daily number of Covid-19 tests done number of tests returned positive. If possible testing data by state as well. To calculate positivity rate for a more accurate view of the pandemic.
